This is test repo to test out the new Markdown Render Hooks in Hugo [0.62.0](https://gohugo.io/news/0.62.0-relnotes/), to demonstrate truly portable Markdown links and images. No shortcodes used.

This means that Markdown links/images should work whether browsed on [GitHub](https://github.com/bep/portable-hugo-links/) or the [Hugo site on Netlify](https://portable-hugo-links.netlify.com/).

**Note** that this project needs Hugo >= 0.62.1 to run.
